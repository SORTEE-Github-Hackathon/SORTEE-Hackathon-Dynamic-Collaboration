## Welcome!

We are both coordinators of a student-run, and student-oriented series of R workshops for ecology and biodiversity science ([GitHub here if you're curious](https://github.com/QCBSRworkshops)). These workshops are updated annually by different students, in two languages (English and French), according to participant feedback we receive each year. This means there are a lot of moving parts, and GitHub helps us track and manage this type of dynamic collaboration in several ways. 

We're excited to talk about some of the tools we use for the workshop series, and how they're used by other people for research in ecology and evolutionary biology, and beyond!

### Session overview

:::info

We'll be showing and discussing some of the available resources to manage collaborations dynamically, with transparency and trackability.<br><br>

* Managing teams that work on several projects (or repositories) via **GitHub Organisations**. 
* Collecting, addressing, and tracking feedback and contributions through **issues and pull requests**.
* Tracking and showcasing contributions to projects with **GitHub Insights**.
* Using **GitHub Actions** to apply continuous integration during document development to safely add contributed changes from many users (who use different systems).

## Part 1: Collaboration tools

### GitHub organisation

* Collaborate with a team (or severak teams) on a larger project with several repositories.
    * 

### Issues and pull-requests

* Allows code or document authors to get user/community feedback to keep their packages/code/document up to date with the literature, address issues, add features that other users want to use for their research, etc. in a transparent way
    * Pull requests allow for contributions from within the team or from other contributors (in a trackable way)
    * Issues and pull requests are easily linked to each other (e.g. "This PR addresses #1")
* Discuss and provide examples for issues and feature requests for packages. A few examples below:
    * [vegan](https://github.com/vegandevs/vegan)
    * [EcoJulia](https://github.com/EcoJulia)
    * [Stanford CCB](https://github.com/stanford-ccb)
    * [Atlas of Living Australia's ALA4R](https://github.com/AtlasOfLivingAustralia/ALA4R)
    * Even GitHub uses this type of feedback [github/feedback](https://github.com/github/feedback)

* Hands-on exercise (15 mins):
    * Create an issue and edit a simple manuscript to fix typos or add ideas through pull-requests


### Tracking (and showcasing) contributions

#### GitHub insights

Tour of some tools on GitHub to track and see contributions
* Commits page
    * 
* Network graph 
    * [Covid-19 review](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review/network)
    * [10SR Git and GitHub](https://github.com/ypriverol/github-paper/network)

#### Automatic showcasing 

* [all-contributors]( https://github.com/all-contributors/app)
* Existing example: Contribution to a review on COVID-19 
  - [covid19-review](https://github.com/greenelab/covid19-review)


#### Github Discussions (*not final*)

* [GitHub Discussions:
An Exploratory Study of Early Adoption](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05230.pdf)

## Part 2: Integration tools


### GitHub Actions
